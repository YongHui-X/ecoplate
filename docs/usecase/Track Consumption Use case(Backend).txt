Track Consumption Use case

Task: Implement backend api end points to support the following usecase

Business Requirement:
User wants to upload a picture of raw ingredients before cooking. And then the user wants to upload a picture of the cooked food that he is throwing away after eating i.e. the “waste” food. Finally he wants to understand and track his food waste and CO2 emission impact.

Code Requirement:
1. Retrieve current products user has in the fridge
2. Process image of raw food to identify which ingredients from the fridge the user has taken out and is planning to cook with. Using chatgpt vision.
3. Process the image of waste food to identify  the ingredients that was taken out and cooked with, which of those are now being thrown away. Using chatgpt vision.

Requirements from front end: 
API 1: Take in an image, return a list of ingredients
API2: Take in an image, return final metrics detailing waste

Handling edge cases:
1. Save the ingredients that was taken out of the fridge via product interactions(refer to the LDM found in /docs). Product interactions use case is still to be implemented.

To be implemented:
1. Product interactions use case
2. Calculate metrics use case
