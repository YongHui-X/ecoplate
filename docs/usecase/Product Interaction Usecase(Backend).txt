Product Interaction Usecase:
Business purpose: To record down the interactions that the user has with products namely what they consume and what they throw away, so that other use cases like dashboard can use this data as tracked data of user behaviour and generate some metrics. 

Requirement:
Every time user interacts with a product it should be logged into the database with the required fields. ID is the product interaction id to be generated, type refers to the type of interaction which must follow these possible interactions ["Add", "Consume", "Waste"].

API endpoints:
Should expose 3 api endpoints each corresponding to add consume and waste that allows the frontend to register the possible interactions by the user. The myfridge database for products must also be updated as these product interactions are registered.

Interaction with "Track Consumption Usecase:
After vision api identifies the ingredients that the user has taken out of the fridge, and the user has confirmed the ingredients on the front end, the product interaction endpoint must be called to register those ingredients as being consumed. This data will then be retrieved by the frontend when resuming to continue the track consumption process.
